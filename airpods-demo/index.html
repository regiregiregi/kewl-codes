<h1>AirPods Pro page is TOO BIG</h1>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.apple.com/kr/airpods-pro/">https://www.apple.com/kr/airpods-pro/</a> contains 1,500+ images and their size is over 60MiB.
</p>
<p>
  I encoded the first 148ea, 4.8MiB of AirPods Pro images into a single 1.1MiB x264 video file and put it as a background.
  The video file has total 148 i-frame frames by ffmpeg's <code>-intra</code> option. It makes much smoother frame changes.
